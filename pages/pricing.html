          <p>Contact me for a free consultation to create a customized bookkeeping package that fits your business needs.</p>
          <p>Do you really need a bookkeeper?  Working with a bookkeeper can lead to significant cost savings—both directly and indirectly.  Here’s just a few benefits of having a financial provider:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Avoid Costly Errors - Bookkeepers help prevent:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Misclassified expenses</li>
              <li>Missed tax deductions</li>
              <li>Overlooked invoices or unpaid bills</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Save Time = Save Money - Time spent doing your own books is time not spent running or growing your business.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Savings: If your time is worth $50/hour and you spend 10 hours/month on bookkeeping, that's $500/month lost productivity.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Smarter Financial Decisions - Up-to-date books mean:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Clear cash flow visibility</li>
              <li>Better budgeting</li>
              <li>Informed business decisions - Avoid overspending, over-hiring, or missing growth opportunities.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Tax Prep is Faster & Cheaper - A bookkeeper keeps your records clean all year—making tax season easier for your accountant.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Lower CPA fees and reduced risk of audits or amendments.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>No Need to Hire In-House - Outsourcing a bookkeeper means:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>No payroll taxes</li>
              <li>No employee benefits</li>
              <li>No training costs</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
